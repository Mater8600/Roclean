# termtool
This tool helps roblox terminators find werid usernames in large groups. It is an attempt to catch "weridos" on the platform, and provide a safer, cleaner enviorment on Roblox.
This was coded pretty quickly,so there are mistakes. Please let me know if you have any suggestions :)


Some features that may come in the future:
1) Searching through a User's groups for flagged ones
2) Better logging, and better varibles
3) Less code





Some things to note:

1) This doesn't search through users (yet!)
2) This is very slow, to avoid rate limting
3) This isn't going to be right all of the time, so please check the flagged users


IF YOU GET INTO ANY TROUBLE USING THIS IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM!
