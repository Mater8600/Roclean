This tool assists Roblox terminators in identifying peculiar usernames within large groups. Its purpose is to detect individuals with unconventional usernames on the platform, thereby contributing to a safer and more wholesome environment on Roblox. This is my first ever publish project,so there is bound to have some errors present. Your suggestions for improvement are welcome. The gui version is almost completely done, just a few more quality of life improvements are needed and possbile stablity

Important considerations:

    Due to precautions against rate limiting, the tool operates at a slower pace.
    It's essential to manually verify flagged users as the tool may not be accurate in all cases.
    fast-main is a sped up version of the orginal main version, but it  is not very stable as of now
