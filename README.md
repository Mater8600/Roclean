This tool assists Roblox terminators in identifying peculiar usernames within large groups. Its purpose is to detect individuals with unconventional usernames on the platform, thereby contributing to a safer and more wholesome environment on Roblox. Since it was developed quickly, there may be some errors present. Your suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Potential future features include:

    Searching through a user's groups for flagged ones. (This one has been implmented, but needs further testing)
    Enhanced logging and variable management.
    Streamlined code for improved efficiency.
    Maybe a google collab?

Important considerations:

    Due to precautions against rate limiting, the tool operates at a slower pace.
    It's essential to manually verify flagged users as the tool may not be accurate in all cases.


Requirements:
