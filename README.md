This tool assists Roblox terminators in identifying peculiar usernames within large groups. Its purpose is to detect individuals with unconventional usernames on the platform, thereby contributing to a safer and more wholesome environment on Roblox. This is my first ever published project,so there is bound to have some errors present. Your suggestions for improvement are welcome. The gui version is almost completely done, just a few more quality of life improvements are needed and possbile stablity



Important considerations:

    Due to precautions against rate limiting, the tool operates at a slower pace.
    It's essential to manually verify flagged users as the tool may not be accurate in all cases.
    The ui is super early access at the moment, and you will encounter bugs.


Requirements:

    json requests Counter re tkinter



Roadmap:
    
    Add more complex features to the gui, and make it more stable
    Add argsparse to "fast-main.py" instead of the annoying system
    Discord bot for ease of use wherever, and whenever, and with a community!
    Auto report feature/ report feature
